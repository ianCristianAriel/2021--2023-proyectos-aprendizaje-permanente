Las reseñas han sido preprocesadas, y cada reseña está codificada como una lista de índices de palabras (números enteros). Para mayor comodidad, las palabras se indexan por frecuencia general en el conjunto de datos, de modo que, por ejemplo, el número entero \"3\" codifica la tercera palabra más frecuente en los datos. Esto permite realizar operaciones de filtrado rápido como considerar sólo las 10.000 palabras más comunes."

       " \" let me begin by saying that this remade version of one of the greatest ever created movies psycho 1960 has been nothing but a fine example of poor direction poor acting and poor cast the best way to describe this movie is by comparing it step by step acting by acting and process by process to the original br br alfred hitchcock one of the greatest movie directors ever lived had an intention to shoot the original in black and white despite the  of color at that time okay people in 1960 may not have been used to bloodshed or horrifying scenes as much as we are today but that didn't prevent people from liking it and getting nominated for 4 oscars gus van  had absolutely no reason to release this in color except that the year was 1998 what should have looked realistic in color did not after the shower scene norman  his hands it is easily that whatever was used for blood looked like some kind of red wax once he  off the blood his hand is red in color br br about acting perhaps there couldn't have been a better cast of janet leigh and anthony  in the original  suited well for norman and he was incredibly natural when he smiles and talks to the stranger  wanted a handsome and good actor and it worked just fine in this version i personally think vince vaughn looked perfect and handsome and strong to play  role unfortunately his acting was nothing less than terrible in the motel office where norman and marion have the long conversation he had zero expression on his face and his voice and face never changes throughout in the original in the same scene when the  is described we can clearly see the sudden change of expression on  face and he looks angry although not  vince vaughn here works out the entire conversation like he's just had his lines by heart again terrible acting same is with anne  in the opening scene in the original we can see how  and nervous marion janet is when she drives to phoenix she was happy in getting the money but at the same time scared for life that's what i call acting in the remake  has no signs of fear and she smiles  for getting the money i don't think anyone would be happy and smiling when they've just stolen and the entire state police is behind them in the shower scene janet in the original grips the curtain turns around and dies after getting stabbed in the remake  gets stabbed turns around then  the other way has a foolish expression on her face and manages to die with great effort again terrible acting br br there are also some specially introduced changes in this movie from the original that seems to have nothing to do with the plot line and the ongoing situation in the scene where gets murdered two scenes blink in between the stabs one with a naked woman and the other with a sheep many people including myself aren't exactly sure whether the second scene showed a sheep or a cow or whatever it was what on earth does a beast or a naked woman have to do with an  murder the changes were just inappropriate and unnecessary there are a couple of changes in the ending scene as well br br let me add some and the only positive points along with that i felt  moore did her job well and played a good character of  and william macy acted well that was almost exactly how character should have been played br br it is common man's knowledge that the purpose and intention of a movie remake is to make the present generation aware of a movie that has a good classic plot line and to try and make it look better than the original and if anything has happened here according to what i just said it is directly the opposite unfortunately many people like me weren't impressed after watching this movie unless we came to know of the existence of an unforgettable original version br br please do not watch this movie it is nowhere near the original and the original will always remain one of the best ever created movies if not the best\",\n",

a fully  masterpiece in its own right br br this is in more ways than one doris day's film not only does she give the finest performance of her career more than holding her own against james stewart but the whole film is subtly structured around her character rather than his this is after all a film in which music is both  and plot device what better casting than the most popular singer of her

between them she responds with a de  that  the  of this gag suggesting that she has a certain   about her  and that they both realise it br br after their son has been kidnapped stewart insists on  her before giving her the news this is a cruel scene brilliantly played by both actors which illustrates the power  in their marriage he is seeking to control and  her reactions in essence using his professional knowledge to  her voice in the marriage just as his medical career has  her singing career br br the  of that voice is demonstrated in the   sequence when she has to reign in its highly trained clarity and volume to blend in with the  of female they almost act as a warning of what will become of her if she continues to  her talent at the albert hall it is her need to cry out to exercise those impressive  that saves a man's life and in the  finale it is her talent and reputation that allows them to locate their son by contrast all of stewart's  activity is  his visit to the

close bond mother and son share through music will allow doris to save the day br br the most famous sequence in the film makes music the central feature the build up to the assassination attempt in the albert hall this lengthy  sequence may be the single most extraordinary thing hitchcock committed to film the ultimate expression of his belief that films should be stories told visually we see people conduct conversations in this sequence but we never hear a word they say we don't need to the images say everything it is also his most exquisite suspense sequence with the pieces moving slowly into place as the music builds the editing is incredibly tight matched to the music perfectly there isn't a frame out of place anything that doesn't relate directly to the assassination is giving the

talking about  he just doesn't get the same amount of attention because his films were never as successful in theaters in fact his best film  cemetery man was probably his least successful or just didn't get the attention he felt it deserved because after that he left film and went into directing television he's never gone back so people really don't know how inferior his other films are because by the time they've seen them they're already fans of the italian horror aesthetic which means you have to accept the fact that they make almost zero sense and are usually very unattractive films this is where the church stands out from the pack because visually it's so cheap and ancient looking you can smell the dust but it has its' charms too though they are few the camera work is truly  and the music score is hugely elaborate and grand br br since  is the reasons people have seen  work all i don't know anyone who caught the church before   and deep red is a bit of a hack sort of like an italian mick  the  example of a director  style over substance the flaws of the church are constant and plenty the film opens with a somewhat interesting prologue showing knights on white horses  through a  village akin to those you see in any robin hood adaptation in some long ago century these scenes are intense enough energetic and get quickly to the point then we cut to the present where the film's style takes over yeah the movie is okay to look at and for about 35 or so minutes in the present 1980's wherever italy the movie is just interesting enough to get us to the slowly revealing horror elements so now we know the purpose of the film is the build up of it's horror and it's a decent build up for the most part but as the movie approaches the halfway point we realize the movie's driving by and nothing is happening br br the plot is very simple i think two people working in a church one as a of books and the other as a of the  wall artwork discover a   that the man thinks will lead them to some kind of buried treasure or priceless  that he can sell and get rich off of so he follows his only to  a force underneath the church that has him while he's slowly becoming a demon who will make everyone else so while he is doing his demon work someone he passed the force onto kills himself in a manner that traps everyone in the church while the demon  onto everyone leaving a black preacher and the little girl who  out of the church every night to go  as the only 2 people who can stop the plague from  beyond the church walls that probably sounds action packed and  style is far more  than  but never before have i seen an attempted  film this  boring i kid you not absolutely nothing happens in the entire film i've seen  or  i'm no film school super  films before but most of them actually show things happening john carpenter's halloween for one br br it follows pretty closely in the footsteps of   demons films since  co produced we're shown to a location where a bunch of people gather one turns into a demon all the others are isolated that person  everyone except a couple survivors then the demons either get out  the world or the survivors get out when the demons die this film puts all those same elements in place except unlike  work nothing happens okay a few things do happen but only one bizarre sequence has the  of much more fun demons films a random woman's neck is  by a demon using a section of fence he rips out of the floor what's bizarre about that you wonder it happens in front of about two dozen people what do they do nothing she dies her head blood in  but all those people don't even notice though it happens in plain view and no less than 8 feet away from them maybe 4 people notice the demon running up to stab anyone he can as he runs toward her so they duck out of the way she's killed and in the shot after she dies everyone is just sitting around being quiet while a boy plays a  i kid you not that's what happens that's more than  incoherent it's plain stupid br br the scene is suggesting that the woman just sort of disappears and no one saw her death they all just up and forget about it and this 15 second thing is absolutely the only event that takes place in the movie i'm not saying it's the only violence gore or murder we see it's not it's just the only thing we can tell is happening for example in one scene a beautiful woman sees herself in a mirror looking old and ugly she starts  the skin on her face off but when she  minutes later no  people are  by fish and their faces are  by subway cars but later they turn up as totally  members of a possessed cult in a scene that commits the ultimate horror   a famous scene from roman  1968 masterpiece rosemary's baby the greatest horror

a new career mode and that is the career the career is basically tony  1 career because there is only about five challenges per level if you missed tony  1 and 2 i suggest that you buy tony  pro  but if you have played the first two games you should still try this one overall there really isn't anything new but it is still very fun to go through the game hopefully this review benefits your needs br br graphics 7 out of 10 overall the clean visuals isn't really one of tony  pro  main characteristics the atmosphere has been changed around a lot from tony  1 and 2 and the character models look a little bit improved when you look back to tony  pro  1 and 2 on the old  the thought that those old graphics are ugly run through your head in tony  pro  the graphics are rendered a lot better the character models are no longer filled with the  are more smooth but not to the  extent tony  pro  visuals do not compare to tony   graphics but  probably didn't want to make tony  pro  have extraordinary graphics overall the graphics deserve an average score of 7 because they did not put the full power of the  to use in here graphics are nice and clean that's all i have to say br br sound 8 out of 10 the sound effects don't deliver much to the imagination but the  popping off of the ground sound great the main reason why i gave the sound factor a rating was because you are not  to listen to the below average tony  soundtrack because there is a  soundtrack feature the sound effects sound a lot better than the sounds in tony  1 and 2 mainly because it is more  and just the fact that everything sounds great one of the main reasons why i bought this game is because of the  soundtrack the  sound effects still sound the same as the first two games did just a little  out one of the major problems of the sound factor is the fact that if the song is over it will not proceed to the next track the song that you have just listened to will just play over again i don't like the in game soundtrack but like i said you are not  to listen to it br br controls 10 out of 10 the controls are the best part of tony  pro  the control set up is  comfortable and easy to get used to back in the  days people thought that the controls were the best ever but it looks like has done a better job with the  control surprisingly it is very easy to use the control stick to  tricks  has done great work with tony  pro  controls they have made the   the best for tony  games you will not be disappointed with the control style and that is a guarantee br br game play 10 out of 10  the fact that tony  pro  is basically tony  1 and 2 put together the game play is still unbelievably fun the game play factor has been changed around a bit this time you get a lot more air than in the first two games and it is a lot easier to perform tricks in tony  pro  each character has three career   of tony  1 career tony  2 career and the career tony  1 career is rather easy because in the first game you get nothing for air the tony  2 career delivers the same amount of difficulty as the  version did the only amount of difficulty that applies to the career is finding out where all items are but after you've done that career is no hard at all in the career there is a total of 3 levels and the first two levels consist of finding the secret tapes collecting s k a t e and doing whatever else is required for that particular level the third level out of the three is the competition level where you have to get a certain amount of points to get the gold in the first two levels the secret tapes and collecting the letters s k a t e are featured in both of them overall tony  pro  still maintains the old tony  pro  vibe br br story br br fun factor 10 out of 10 tony  pro  is by far the most  game on  today i have played tony  pro  1 and 2 and back then i didn't like them but for some reason tony  pro  is really fun there really isn't much to say except that tony  pro  is by far the best game on  today one problem is that if you've already gone through the game once you will play it a couple more times but it will be repetitive br br replay value 10 out of 10 tony  pro  delivers a high amount of replay value there is a lot of  to  and a lot of character videos overall tony  pro  has lots of replay value mainly because it is so fun br br best feature you are not  to listen to the crappy in game soundtrack worst feature the  soundtrack is a bit messed up br br final statement lots of people have complained in the past that they didn't like tony  pro  because there is
